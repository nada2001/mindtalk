# mindtalk
Mindtalk is a chatroom application designed to provide a safe and supportive environment for individuals who struggle with mental health issues, such as anxiety. Our goal is to create a community where people can connect with others who understand what they're going through, share their experiences, and help each other grow.

## Tools
- Websocket: Mindtalk uses Websocket technology to provide real-time communication between users. This means that conversations flow smoothly and without interruption, providing a seamless chat experience.
- Spring Security: We take user security seriously, and that's why we use Spring Security to authenticate users and ensure that their information is protected.
- Spring JPA and Hibernate: Mindtalk uses Spring JPA and Hibernate to manage our database connections and data modeling. This allows us to store user data and chat logs in a secure and efficient way.
- MySQL: Our application uses MySQL as its database system, providing a reliable and scalable backend infrastructure.
